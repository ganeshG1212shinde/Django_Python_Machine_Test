# Django-Python-Machine-Test

Assignment for Nimap Infotech

Consider the following scenario where we have 3 entities in our system.

    User

    Client

    Project

We have the number of users registered in our system.

You can use Djangoâ€™s default admin template to create/register users but not other entities or you can make REST APIs for users as well if you want.

You have to perform the following tasks :

    Register a client

    Fetch clients info

    Edit/Delete client info

    Add new projects for a client and assign users to those projects.

    Retrieve assigned projects to logged-in users.

Things to consider :

    The system has many users.

    The system has many clients.

    A client can have many projects

    A single project can be assigned to many users.
